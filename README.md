# Emotion Detector
CNN to detect the emotion on a person's face.
Utilized the FER 2013 dataset to create the CNN model.


As of 5/22/19, the network does well on classifying images where the facial expression shows happiness, but is not very consistent with it's predictions for other facial expressions.
